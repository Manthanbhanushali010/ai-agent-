# 🚀 Easy Ways to Upload Your Code to GitHub

## Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Easiest - 2 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Your Repository
Visit: [https://github.com/Manthanbhanushali010/ai-agent-](https://github.com/Manthanbhanushali010/ai-agent-)

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. **Drag and drop** all your project files OR click **"choose your files"**
3. **Important**: Upload these key files first:
   - `package.json`
   - `next.config.js`
   - `tailwind.config.js`
   - `tsconfig.json`
   - `README.md`
   - `.gitignore`

### Step 3: Upload the src folder
1. Create a new file called `src/app/layout.tsx`
2. Copy-paste the content from your local file
3. Repeat for all files in the `src` directory

### Step 4: Commit
1. Scroll down to **"Commit changes"**
2. Title: `🚀 Initial commit - Meet AI Platform`
3. Click **"Commit changes"**

## Method 2: Try Git Push Again

The network might have been temporarily interrupted. Let's try:

```bash
# Clear any cached credentials
git config --global --unset credential.helper

# Try pushing again with force
git push -f origin main

# Or try with token authentication
git push https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Manthanbhanushali010/ai-agent-.git main
```

---

## Method 3: Create ZIP and Upload

```bash
# Create a ZIP of your project
zip -r meet-ai-platform.zip . -x "node_modules/*" ".git/*" ".next/*"
```

Then:
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
3. Upload the ZIP and extract

---

## Method 4: GitHub Desktop (User-Friendly)

1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. **Clone** your repository: `https://github.com/Manthanbhanushali010/ai-agent-`
3. **Copy** all your project files into the cloned folder
4. **Commit & Push** through the GUI
