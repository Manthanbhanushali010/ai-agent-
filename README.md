```
"Implement a complete PostgreSQL database schema using Drizzle ORM for the Meet AI platform. Create tables for:

1. Users table with authentication fields (id, email, name, avatar, created_at)
2. Agents table (id, user_id, name, description, instructions, voice_settings, created_at, updated_at)
3. Meetings table (id, user_id, agent_id, title, description, scheduled_for, status, recording_url, transcript, created_at)
4. Meeting_participants table for future multi-user support

## üéØ Usage Guidelines

### For AI-Assisted Development

1. **Start Specific**: Use focused prompts for single features rather than multiple features at once
2. **Include Context**: Reference existing code structure and patterns when requesting changes
3. **Specify Testing**: Always ask for proper error handling and user experience considerations
4. **Database First**: When adding features, start with database schema changes, then API, then UI
5. **Type Safety**: Emphasize TypeScript types and tRPC integration in all prompts

### Development Workflow

1. **Feature Planning**: Break large features into smaller, testable components  
2. **Database Changes**: Always backup and test database migrations
3. **API Development**: Test tRPC procedures independently before UI integration
4. **UI Components**: Build reusable components following the existing Shadcn UI patterns
5. **Testing**: Include unit tests for critical business logic
